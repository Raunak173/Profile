          I'm Raunak Agarwal. I'm a passionate Coding Enthusiast and a MERN
          Stack web developer. I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering Student
          and a HBTU Sophomore. Currently I'm working as a full stack intern at
          BlokMiners. I also love contributing to open source. I'm also a good
          problem solver. I have solved more than 350 questions on Leetcode.
          Besides coding, I love binging Animes and trying different cuisines.
