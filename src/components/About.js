          I'm Raunak Agarwal, a Final Year Engineering Student at HBTU Kanpur.
          I've got around 2 years of experience working with JavaScript, React,
          and React Native to build websites and mobile apps. I've also created
          APIs using Java, Spring Boot, Node, and Express. I love solving
          problems, and I've tackled over 400 questions on LeetCode and 250+ on
          CodeStudio. This helps me stay sharp and keeps me ready for the
          challenges of software development. I'm not just about coding; I'm
          into making sure things work smoothly. I've got experience in
          automation testing using Cucumber JS, making sure our software is
          reliable. What I bring goes beyond my technical skills. I was honored
          to win the Smart India Hackathon 2022. This experience taught me to
          think on my feet, work well with others, and come up with innovative
          solutions.
